                    <p>The journey begins in 2005. With a view to 
spreading the knowledge of English among the students of Notre Dame 
College with the help of exciting and innovative events, Nirjhor 
Adhikary, the founding Moderator of the Club, currently serving as the 
First secretary to the French embassy of Bangladesh, took forth the 
initiative of establishing Notre Dame English Club. Thus, with a few 
dozen members and a head full of dreams, NDEC set sail on its journey 
towards linguistic excellence. Since then, Notre Dame English Club has 
been working for the development of English skills of the students of 
Notre Dame College through regular classes and workshops on various 
interesting topics of the language. The initial years are always the 
most challenging for an up and coming organization. But with the 
persistence, determination and hardwork of the initial members, the club
 made huge strides towards success attracting an abundance of students 
through their noteworthy activities.

                    <p>Under the guidance of our Ex-Club Moderator,
 Suranjita Barua and Ex-Co-Moderator, Humayun Kabir, in 2013, NDEC 
hosted its first ever national event in the form of “Eastern Bank 
Limited presents 1st National English Carnival-2013”. Till now, NDEC has
 hosted 9 National Carnivals. Each time, we challenged ourselves to 
bring in fresh, bold ideas and surpass our previous selves in quality. 
Over the years, thousands of participants participated in the carnival 
to learn something new and hone their skills making all our efforts 
worthwhile.

                        In a world where competition is reaching newer 
heights by the day, there is no alternative to mastering the aspects of 
English and NDEC serves the very purpose of developing a skilled 
community expert in all branches of English, which is evident in the 
club motto "Whole universe in one soul, Learn English to reach the 
goal". NDEC has not only been working towards its goal inside the 
college but also at national scales. The 9 National English Carnivals 
are the glaring examples of it.

 both are equally essential for achieving success. Every year, our club 
welcomes freshmen who are eagerly determined to accomplish outstanding 
feats through constant tough grind and perseverance. NDEC gives all its 
members the opportunity to flourish in extracurricular activities as 
well as leadership and training to develop your English skills. 
</p><p>Today, we can proudly say that NDEC is not only a premier club of
 Notre Dame College but is also keeping pace with all the college level 
clubs of the country in terms of the quality of its activities. Even 
though it has been a long and illustrious journey spanning over 15 
years, we believe its just the start. And we remain as determined as 
ever to keep spreading the euphoria of learning English among the 
students of our country, to keep surpassing ourselves. As Robert Frost 
wrote, “And miles to go before I sleep.”
